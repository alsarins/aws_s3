# [s3proxy](s3proxy) - proxy with encryption

Modified https://github.com/abustany/s3proxy
### See [changes](s3proxy/README.md)

INFO: Multipart uploads are not supported. It's difficult to encrypt separate parts, instead of whole unencrypted file, and decrypt file back in original consistent state. Looks like it's a big challenge for now. Maybe later there will be a solution for this problem.
